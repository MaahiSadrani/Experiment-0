Aim:
Introduction to Python 

Theory: 
Variables in Python are used to store data values such as names, numbers, or arrays.
For example, we can store "Maahi" in a variable and 2 in another variable.
The print() statement is used to display these values on the screen.
Using print(), we can output text, numbers, and even arrays together.
This helps us check program results and understand how data is processed.

Conclusion: 
Therefore we learn different ways to initialise variables having strings integers and an array 
and how to print these in a systematic order with the help of python.
